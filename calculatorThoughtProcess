First thinking about things the calculator will need

     Buttons numbering 1-9
     Ability to multiply, divide, add, subtract
     To have user unable to enter text into field
     External Java sheet using if then statements
     External CSS 

Order of tasks

    1. Buttons on HTML file 
    2. Java sheet if then functions
    3. Orginization of buttons into columns
    4. External CSS
    
Trouble I am having
     
     Seperation of functions for operations and number input
     Displaying the button input without allowing user text input
     Did not start on CSS yet as I would think that should be the last part completed.
     Spent most of my hour researching functions, specifically if statements. Seems to be a bad weakpoint as Java script is very new to me still.
